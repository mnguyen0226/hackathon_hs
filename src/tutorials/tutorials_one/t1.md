# Tutorial 2: Scripted Agents Showdown

This tutorial is inspired from ["Creating a simple max damage player"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/max_damage_player.html) example from Poke-env. We will show:
- How to create a random action pokebot.
- How to create a max damage action pokebot
- How to have them fight each other on the same machine

**Note:** You will not need to create Pokemon-Showdown account for your bot in this tutorial since you will be host your bot on your local server.
