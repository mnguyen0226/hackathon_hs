# Tutorial 4: Random Agent vs Max Damage Agent On Pokemon Showdown

This tutorial is inspired from ["Creating a simple max damage player"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/max_damage_player.html) and ["Connecting to showdown and challenging humans"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting_to_showdown_and_challenging_humans.html) examples from Poke-env. We will show:
- How to have your scripted Max Damage Agent fight against Random Agent on Pokemon Showdown on two different browsers / machines.

**Note:** You will need to create two Pokemon-Showdown account for your Random Agent and your Max Damage Agent in this tutorial since you will fight on global server of Pokemon Showdown. You will need two laptops/machines or two browsers (one private, one public).


**Note:** The code for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/mnguyen0226/hackathon_hs/tree/main/src/tutorials/tutorials_three). 

Assuming that you have already got the installation and was able to put up your local server like this:

```
RESTORE CHATROOM: lobby
RESTORE CHATROOM: staff
Worker 1 now listening on 0.0.0.0:8000
Test your server at http://localhost:8000
```
**Note:** Make sure to keep your local server runs at all time.


Next, [create](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-sign-up-for-Pokemon-Showdown#:~:text=Go%20to%20Showdown!,the%20picture%20and%20its%20done!) two Pokemon Showdown accounts, one for you and one for your bot. In this example, "mnguyen" is the account for Random Agent and "minheapolis_bot" is the account for the Max Damage Agent. After create your accounts, log your accounts in two browser on [Pokemon Showdown global server](https://pokemonshowdown.com/)

Next, generate the MaxDamagePlayer pokemon similar to Tutorial 2:
```
class MaxDamagePlayer(Player):
    def choose_move(self, battle):
        """Choose the best move of the max damage player.
        If the agents can attack then it will choose the best move,
        else it will be a random move

        Parameter
        ----------
        battle:
            Max damage player's turn in the battle

        Return
        ----------
        Either max-damage-move or random move
        """
        # If the player can attack, it will
        if battle.available_moves:
            # Finds the best move among available ones
            best_move = max(battle.available_moves, key=lambda move: move.base_power)
            return self.create_order(best_move)

        # If no attacks is available, a random switch will be made
        else:
            return self.choose_random_move(battle)
```

Next, write a script that to create a player for your bot, link it with Pokemon Showdown "minheapolis_bot" account, and challenge the "mnguyen" account:
```
async def main():
    # Create a max damage player with an account
    pokebot = MaxDamagePlayer(
        player_configuration=PlayerConfiguration("minheapolis_bot", "heron_is_a_bird"),
        server_configuration=ShowdownServerConfiguration,
    )

    # Sending challenges to "your_username"
    await pokebot.send_challenges("mnguyen", n_challenges=1)

    # Accepting one challenge from any user
    await pokebot.accept_challenges(None, 1)

    # Accepting three challenges from "your_username"
    await pokebot.accept_challenges("mnguyen", 2)

    # Playing 5 games on the ladder
    await pokebot.ladder(5)

    # Print the rating of the player and tis opponent after each battle
    for battle in pokebot.battles.values():
        print(battle.rating, battle.opponent_rating)
```
