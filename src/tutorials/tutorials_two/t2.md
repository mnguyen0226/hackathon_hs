# Tutorial 2: Scripted Agents Fight On Pokemon Showdown

This tutorial is inspired from ["Creating a simple max damage player"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/max_damage_player.html) example from Poke-env. We will show:
- How to create a random action pokebot.
- How to create a max damage action pokebot
- How to have them fight each other on the same machine

**Note:** You will not need to create Pokemon-Showdown account for your bot in this tutorial since you will be host your bot on your local server.


**Note:** The code for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/mnguyen0226/hackathon_hs/blob/main/src/tutorials/tutorials_two/max_dam_vs_random.py)



Assuming that you have already got the installation and was able to put up your local server like this

```
RESTORE CHATROOM: lobby
RESTORE CHATROOM: staff
Worker 1 now listening on 0.0.0.0:8000
Test your server at http://localhost:8000
```

We will first create a **MaxDamagePlayer()** class like this:
```
class MaxDamagePlayer(Player):
    def choose_move(self, battle):
        """Choose the best move of the max damage player.
        If the agents can attack then it will choose the best move,
        else it will be a random move

        Parameter
        ----------
        battle:
            Max damage player's turn in the battle

        Return
        ----------
        Either max-damage-move or random move
        """
        # If the player can attack, it will
        if battle.available_moves:
            # Finds the best move among available ones
            best_move = max(battle.available_moves, key=lambda move: move.base_power)
            return self.create_order(best_move)

        # If no attacks is available, a random switch will be made
        else:
            return self.choose_random_move(battle)
```

We will then let the Random Action player played against the MaxDamagePlayer for 100 games
```
async def main():
    # Start the time tracker
    start = time.time()

    # We create two players
    random_player = RandomPlayer(battle_format="gen8randombattle")
    max_damage_player = MaxDamagePlayer(battle_format="gen8randombattle")

    # Let the max-damage player fight against the random player 100 battles
    await max_damage_player.battle_against(random_player, n_battles=100)

    # Print the results
    print(
        f"Max damage player won {max_damage_player.n_won_battles} / 100 battles [this took {time.time() - start} seconds]"
    )
```

On local terminal, run your script similar to [this](https://github.com/mnguyen0226/hackathon_hs/blob/main/src/tutorials/tutorials_two/max_dam_vs_random.py) and you should get result like this on your terminal
```
Max damage player won 90 / 100 battles [this took 13.735309839248657 seconds]
```

To see your MaxDamagePlayer scripted agent in actions, log to http://localhost:8000 and you should see something like this:
