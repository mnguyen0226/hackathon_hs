# Tutorial 3: You vs Scripted Agents On Pokemon Showdown

This tutorial is inspired from ["Creating a simple max damage player"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/max_damage_player.html) and ["Connecting to showdown and challenging humans"](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting_to_showdown_and_challenging_humans.html) examples from Poke-env. We will show:
- How to fight against your scripted Max Damage Agent on Pokemon Showdown

**Note:** You will need to create two Pokemon-Showdown account for you and your bot in this tutorial since you will fight on global server of Pokemon Showdown. You will need two laptops/machines or two browsers (one private, one public).


**Note:** The code for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/mnguyen0226/hackathon_hs/tree/main/src/tutorials/tutorials_three). 

Assuming that you have already got the installation and was able to put up your local server like this:

```
RESTORE CHATROOM: lobby
RESTORE CHATROOM: staff
Worker 1 now listening on 0.0.0.0:8000
Test your server at http://localhost:8000
```
**Note:** Make sure to keep your local server runs at all time.


Next, [create](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-sign-up-for-Pokemon-Showdown#:~:text=Go%20to%20Showdown!,the%20picture%20and%20its%20done!) two Pokemon Showdown accounts, one for you and one for your bot. In this example, "mnguyen" is the account for user and "minheapolis_bot" is the account for the pokebot. After create your accounts, log your accounts in two browser on [Pokemon Showdown global server](https://pokemonshowdown.com/)

Next, generate the MaxDamagePlayer pokemon similar to Tutorial 2. 
```
class MaxDamagePlayer(Player):
    def choose_move(self, battle):
        """Choose the best move of the max damage player.
        If the agents can attack then it will choose the best move,
        else it will be a random move

        Parameter
        ----------
        battle:
            Max damage player's turn in the battle

        Return
        ----------
        Either max-damage-move or random move
        """
        # If the player can attack, it will
        if battle.available_moves:
            # Finds the best move among available ones
            best_move = max(battle.available_moves, key=lambda move: move.base_power)
            return self.create_order(best_move)

        # If no attacks is available, a random switch will be made
        else:
            return self.choose_random_move(battle)
```
